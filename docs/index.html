            <br>
            <p>
                <b>Taylor Alison Swift</b> (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter.
                Her narrative songwriting, which is often inspired by her personal experiences, has received widespread media coverage and critical praise.
            </p>
            <p>
                Based in Nashville, Tennessee, Swift signed with Sony/ATV Tree Publishing in 2004 to become a songwriter and with Big Machine Records in 2005 to become a country music singer.
                <br>
                Her eponymous debut studio album (2006) included the Hot Country Songs number-one singles "Our Song" and "Should've Said No" and the pop radio crossover "Teardrops on My Guitar". Swift rose to mainstream prominence with her country pop second studio album, Fearless (2008), which was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and featured the top-five singles "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me". Her third studio album, Speak Now (2010), blended country pop with rock elements and furthered her crossover success with the top-ten singles "Mine" and "Back to December".
            </p>
            <p>
                Swift's fourth studio album, Red (2012), experimented beyond country, incorporating pop, rock, and electronic genres.
                <br>
                She completely transitioned to pop with her synth-pop fifth studio album, 1989 (2014); its successor, Reputation (2017), expanded on the electropop sound with urban influences.
                <br>
                Swift released her next studio album, Lover, in 2019, while she was involved in a dispute over the ownership of her back catalog after her Big Machine contract expired.
                <br>
                She explored indie folk and alternative rock on her 2020 studio albums, Folklore and Evermore.
                <br>
                These six albums spawned a string of international top-ten singles, including:
                <ul>
                    <li>We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together</li>

                    <li>Shake it off</li>
                    <li>Blank Space</li>
                    <li>Bad blood</li>
